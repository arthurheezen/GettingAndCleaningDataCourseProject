# GettingAndCleaningDataCourseProject
Arthur Heezen's submission for the Coursera "Gettinga and Cleaning Data" course

In order to recreate the output tidy dataset, you can execute "run_analysis.R"

The script requires the current working directory to contain the "UCI HAR Dataset"
as extracted from:
  https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

The tidy data set will be output to the current directory as
  SummaryUCIHAR.txt
